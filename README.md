# Video-Classification-CNN-and-LSTM
To classify videos into various classes using keras library with tensorflow as back-end.

I have taken 5 classes from sports 1M dataset like unicycling, marshal arts, dog agility, jetsprint and clay pigeon shooting. First I have captured the frames per sec from the video and stored the images. I gave the labels to those images and trained them on VGG16 pretrained model. 

I achieved 78% accuracy on frames using CNN model, 73% accuracy on whole videos using CNN model, 81% accuracy on frames using CNN-LSTM architecture, 77% accuracy on videos using CNN-LSTM.

I want to learn something really usefull about CNN. Any adivice?
